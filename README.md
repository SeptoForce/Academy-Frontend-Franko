# Frontend Sofascore Academy 2024 Homework Repository

Welcome to my personal repository for the Frontend Sofascore Academy 2024. Here, I will be submitting all my homework assignments and documenting my learning journey throughout the course.

## About Me

My name is Franko Žarković, and I'm a passionate frontend developer with a background in computer science. I joined the Sofascore Academy to further develop my skills and learn from industry professionals. My goal is to become a well-rounded frontend developer and contribute to the tech community.

### Submission Structure

- **Folders:** Each homework is in its separate folder named `hw01`.
- **Branches:** Each assignment is developed in its own branch named after the homework (e.g., `hw01`).
- **Pull Requests:** Completed assignments are submitted through pull requests, which are then reviewed by the instructors.
